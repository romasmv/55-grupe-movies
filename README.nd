## 🌟 About

This project is for educational purposes only. On this page, I use React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and a phpMyAdmin MariaDB MySQL database. The page includes React context wrappers, state management, and useEffect hooks. It features user registration and login with hashed passwords. Each master has a like count, represented by a FontAwesome heart icon (red for liked, white for not liked). Likes are stored in the database
